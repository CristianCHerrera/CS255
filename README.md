The DriverPass project was a system that was designed for a client named DriverPass, who operate a driving school. The reason for the systems'
creation was to allow for there to be proper system that was able to handle all aspects setting up an in-person appointment, as well as taking online
practice tests, and studying up on appropriate driving literature. 

Looking back, I would revise the UML use case diagram, because I feel that despite the key components of the system being included, there is 
opportunity for the diagram to be more thorough. 

In this case, the users' needs were gathered through an interview, where we were given key information, and asked for clarifying information as 
needed. Making sure that we have accurately gathered the client's needs is essential because if there is a component we are unsure about and 
decide to choose for them, we run the risk of having a disatisfied customer.
